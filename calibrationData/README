Explanation of file contents
-------------------------------

gainBGOcalibration.dat:
	According to Nagata the columns in the calibration file correspond to:
	
	1: channel number
	2: gain
	3-5 : unknown, Nagata sais it is LED conditions while measuring, the
	      gain data is already corrected for it

hodoscopeTimingCorrectionTable.dat:
	Contains timing and amplitude correction data for the hodoscope
	
	1: channel number
	2: timingCorr Inner hodoscope
	3: timingCorr Inner hodoscope
	4: Amplitude correction factor inner hodoscope
	5: Amplitude correction factor outer hodoscope

	usage:
	CF timing : Constant Fraction Downstream + (2 or 3)
	Amplitude : Amplitude Downstream * (4 or 5)
